Text classification is the task of assigning a sentence or document an appropriate category. The categories depend on the chosen dataset and can range from topics.

Text classification classification problems include emotion classification, news classification, citation intent classification, among others. Benchmark datasets for evaluating text classification capabilities include GLUE, AGNews, among others.

In recent years, deep learning techniques like XLNet and RoBERTa have attained some of the biggest performance jumps for text classification problems.
