title: Logical Representations of Sentence Meaning
---

### What are meaning representations?
Formal structures to capture the meaning of linguistic expressions.

### What is semantic parsing or semantic analysis?
The process by which meaning representations are created and assigned to linguistic inputs.

### What is computational semantics?
The entire enterprise of designing meaning representations and associated semantic parsers.

### Give examples of meaning representations?
1. First order logic
1. Abstract meaning representation
1. Slot-filler representation

### What are the computational desiderata for representations?
1. Verifiability
1. Unambiguous representations
1. Canonical form
1. Inference and variables
1. Expressiveness

### What does the vocabulary of meaning representation consist of?
1. Non-logical vocabulary: open-ended set of names for the objects, properties, and relations that make up the world we are trying to represent.
1. Logical vocabulary: closet set of symbols, operators, quantifiers, links, etc. that provide the formal means for composing expressions.

### What are the objects, properties, and relations of a domain?
1. Objects denote elements of the domain
1. Properties denote sets of elements of the domain
1. Relations denote sets of tuples of elements of the domain

### What is a feature used by human languages to convey meaning?
Predicate-argument structure

### What is First-Order Logic?
First-Order Logic is a well-understood, computationally tractable meaning representation language that offers much of what is needed in a meaning representation language. It can capture states, events, semantic networks, and frames.

### What is Web Ontology Language (OWL)?
OWL is description logic, which are subsets of the full First-Order Logic. It is used in the specification of the semantic web.
